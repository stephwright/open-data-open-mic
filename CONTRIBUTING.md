# Contribution Guidelines

Jumping into a new project can be hard and intimidating. This document is designed to help you understand the community and how to interact.

### What is this repository about?  
**Open data is data that is made freely and easily available to anyone to use, re-use and distribute.**  
<sub>*(Definition adapted from [Open Knowledge](http://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/what-is-open-data/))*</sub>

This project is the brainchild of a small group ([Raja Cholan](https://twitter.com/what_raja_says), [Eva Montenegro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evamontenegro), [Charlie Rapple](https://twitter.com/charlierapple), and [Stephanie Wright](https://twitter.com/shefw)) who got together and decided to focus on how to spread the gospel of open data.  See the [Read Me](README.md) for more on that story.
